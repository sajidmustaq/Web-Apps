        The Story in the Book
    </h1>
    <h2> Chapter 1 </h2>
    <P>
        <B>Molly</B>  had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the
        copies of Nature, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well
        thumbed <i>copy of On The Road</i>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these
        four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
    </P>
    <p>
        She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under
        a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to
        do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an outstanding
        achievement, Molly did think she had something better to do..

        <strong>Themes</strong> and styles also help keep your document coordinated. When you click Design and choose a
        new Theme, the pictures, charts,
        and SmartArt graphics change to match your new theme. When you apply styles, your headings change to match the
        new theme.
        Save time in Word with new buttons that show up where you need them.
        To change the way a picture <em>fits</em> in your document, click it and a button for layout options appears
        next to it.
        When you work on a table, click where you want to add a row or a column, and then click the plus sign.

    <h5>Example of blockquote and q tag</h5>
    <p>
    <blockquote cite="www.world.com"> To make your document look professionally produced, Word provides header, footer,
        cover page, and text box designs that complement each other. For example,
        you can add a matching cover page, header, and sidebar. Click Insert and then choose the elements you want from
        the different galleries.
    </blockquote>

    <p>He said <q>Reading is easier, too, in the new Reading view. You can collapse parts of the document and focus on
            the text you want.
            If you need to stop reading before you reach the end, Word remembers where you left off - even on another
            device</q></p>
    <h3>Example of Abbreviation tag </h3>
